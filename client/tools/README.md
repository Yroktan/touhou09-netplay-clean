# decomp-tools

Tooling for matching decompilations of Touhou games built with MSVC 7
(Visual C++ .NET 2002) under Wine, on Linux. The goal of such a project
is C++ source that compiles, with the original toolchain, into code
byte-for-byte identical to the original executable.

The tools compile the game's source under Wine, compare every function
with the original byte for byte, hook the new code into the running game
through a DLL, link a standalone executable and compare it with the
original section by section, drive the game headless under Xvfb, and
analyze the original with headless Ghidra.

## Clean room

This repository holds tools only. It contains no game code or data, no
decompiled source, no symbol tables and nothing from Microsoft's
toolchain or SDKs. Each game repository brings its own source and
symbols, and each user brings their own copy of the game and the
compiler.

## Using it in a game repository

A game repository includes this repository as a git submodule at
`tools/`, describes itself in `project.toml` at its root, and
imports the shared recipes into its justfile:

```just
import 'tools/common.just'

# the game's own recipes follow
```

It expects this layout around it:

```
project.toml  the game's settings (see below)
justfile      imports tools/common.just
config/       symbols.csv: address, size, name and mangled symbol
src/          decompiled source; src/dll/ is the hook DLL's own code,
              src/exe/ the data and globals only the standalone exe builds
orig/         the user's game files (not tracked) and their checksums
.wine/        the Wine prefix with the toolchain (not tracked)
build/        outputs
tools/        this repository
```

`examples/` has the configuration of th06, th07 and th08, and th06's
build hook. To add the tools to a game repository:

```sh
git submodule add https://github.com/Cirno-Labs/decomp-tools.git tools
cp tools/examples/th07.toml project.toml   # then adapt it
echo "import 'tools/common.just'" > justfile
just tools-init hooks
```

## Recipes

`just` lists them. `common.just` has:

| Recipe | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `build` | compile `src/` and link the hook DLL, `build/<name>.dll` |
| `compare [SYMBOL...]` | compare every compiled function with the original; disassembly diffs for SYMBOLs |
| `game` | set up `build/game/`: the game's files, an exe patched to load the DLL, the DLL |
| `run [STEP...]` | run the patched game headless (`wait:S key:K hold:K:S shot:NAME`) |
| `exe [STEP...]` | link the standalone `build/<name>.exe`; `FEAT=a,b` turns on features |
| `check-exe` | link the standalone exe and fail unless it is the original byte for byte |
| `compare-exe [-v]` | compare the standalone exe with the original, section by section |
| `replay [RPY...]` | play replays to their end headless in the original, twice, and the standalone exe, and compare every calculation (`replay/replay.py`, with `replay.hook`) |
| `psdk-libs ZIP` | extract VS.NET 2002's Platform SDK import libraries from its install media |
| `analyze` | analyze the original with headless Ghidra, seed `config/symbols.csv` |
| `decompile [ADDR...]` | write Ghidra's pseudocode to `build/decomp/` |
| `permute NAME [ARGS]` | search source variants of a function for a byte match (see [The permuter](#the-permuter)) |
| `farm [ARGS]` | permute every `hooks.allow_diff` function unattended, several at once |
| `progress` | build, then render `docs/progress.svg` |
| `hooks` | use `tools/hooks/`: 50/72 commit messages without type prefixes or trailers, with `hooks.compare` only matching functions besides `hooks.allow_diff`, with `hooks.readme` only existing paths in `README.md`, and with `hooks.progress` a progress image in every commit |
| `clean` | remove build outputs (keeps the Ghidra project) |

Compiles run on half the cores; `JOBS` overrides it. Ghidra is found
through `GHIDRA`, `ghidra.path` or the newest `~/opt/ghidra_*`.

### The submodule

| Recipe | Runs |
| --- | --- |
| `tools-init` | `git submodule update --init tools`, then puts `tools/` on a `main` branch at the recorded commit |
| `tools-pull` | `git pull --ff-only` on `tools/`' `main` |
| `tools-push` | `git push` of `tools/`' `main` to `git@github.com:Cirno-Labs/decomp-tools.git` |

`tools/` is a checkout of this repository, so a change to the tools is
a commit made inside `tools/` (`git -C tools commit`), pushed with
`just tools-push`. The game repository then records the new commit
with a commit of its own (`git add tools`). In the other games,
`just tools-pull` and commit the pointer the same way.

A fresh clone of a game needs `git clone --recursive`, or
`git submodule update --init tools` after it: the justfile imports
from `tools/`, so `just` can't run before. Either leaves `tools/` on a
detached HEAD, where a commit belongs to no branch; `just tools-init`
puts it on `main` at the same commit.

## Tools

| File | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `project.py` | reads `project.toml`; the `orig`, `game`, `standalone`, `check-exe` and `clean` steps |
| `build.py` | compiles `src/` (Shift-JIS, per-file flags, parallel), writes the hook table and thunks, links the DLL and the standalone exe |
| `compare.py` | compares compiled functions with the original, relocations resolved through `symbols.csv` |
| `compare_exe.py` | compares the standalone exe with the original: headers, Rich header, sections, imports, code and data by symbol |
| `order.py` | lists, per object, which of the standalone exe's functions sit at their original address and in the original's order (`--summary`: one line per object) |
| `reorder.py` | sorts a `.cpp`'s function definitions into the original's address order |
| `patch_exe.py` | adds the hook DLL to a copy of the original's import table |
| `play.py` | runs the game under Xvfb, sends keys, takes screenshots |
| `seed_symbols.py` | adds Ghidra's functions and the imports to `symbols.csv` |
| `name.py` | names a row of `symbols.csv` |
| `rename.py` | renames functions in the working tree or throughout history |
| `render_progress.py` | draws the progress image |
| `permute.py` | searches rewrites of one function (declaration, operand and statement order, if/else, loop and condition forms) for a byte match, compiling each variant alone |
| `farm.py` | runs `permute.py` over every `hooks.allow_diff` function, several at once, unattended; keeps matching bodies in `build/farm/`, and `--apply` writes them into `src/` |
| `gate.py` | the commit rule `hooks.compare` turns on, for the pre-commit hook |
| `readme_paths.py` | the commit rule `hooks.readme` turns on: every repository path `README.md` names must exist |
| `locals.py` | predicts and picks local variable names for a wanted stack layout under `/Od` |
| `psdk_libs.py`, `msi_extract.py` | extract import libraries from the VS.NET 2002 media |
| `coff.py`, `rsrc.py`, `peinfo.py` | COFF objects, resources, PE and Rich header |
| `ghidra/` | headless Ghidra: analysis, function export, decompilation |
| `hooks/` | `commit-msg` and `pre-commit` |

## project.toml

Paths are relative to the game repository's root. Hex numbers are
written as such (`0x46004B`). `DECOMP_PROJECT` names another file.

### `[game]`

| Key | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | required | short name: `build/<name>.dll`, `build/<name>.exe`, `<name>.exe` in `build/game/`, the hook log's prefix |
| `dir` | required | the original game's files, such as `orig/th07_100b` |
| `exe` | required | the original executable's file name in `dir` |
| `original` | required | where the verified executable is copied, an ASCII path such as `build/th07_100b.exe` |
| `game_end` | required | the address the game's code ends at; library code follows |
| `checksums` | none | a `sha1sum -c` file, run from its own directory |
| `title` | `name` | the progress image's title |
| `progress_exclude` | `[]` | name globs of `symbols.csv` rows no source makes, such as linker thunks, left out of the progress |
| `window_title` | `title` | the window `play.py` looks for |
| `standalone_extras` | `[]` | globs copied into `build/game/` with the standalone exe |

### `[ghidra]`

| Key | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `path` | none | the Ghidra installation; `GHIDRA` overrides it |
| `project` | `original`'s name without `.exe` | the Ghidra project in `build/ghidra/` |
| `functions` | `build/functions_<project>.csv` | the exported function list |

### `[build]`

| Key | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cflags` | required | the compiler flags; a source file's first line `// cflags: /Os -/Oi` adds and removes some |
| `bin` | `C:\msvc7\bin` | where `cl.exe` and `link.exe` are, in the Wine prefix |
| `include` | `C:\dx8\include`, `C:\msvc7\include`, `C:\psdk\Include` | `INCLUDE` |
| `lib` | `C:\dx8\lib`, `C:\msvc7\lib`, `C:\msvc7\PlatformSDK\Lib`, `C:\psdk\Lib` | `LIB`, in search order |
| `timeout` | `60` | seconds before a compile counts as hung |
| `hook` | none | a Python file with the game's own build steps, see below |

### `[dll]`

| Key | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ldflags` | `/DLL /NODEFAULTLIB /ENTRY:DllMain /BASE:0x30000000` | the hook DLL's linker flags |
| `libs` | `kernel32.lib user32.lib winmm.lib` | its libraries |

### `[exe]`

| Key | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `obj_dir` | `build/obj_exe` | the standalone exe's objects; `build/obj` shares the DLL's |
| `cflags` | `[]` | flags added to `build.cflags`, before a file's own; with `/GL` the exe is a second, `/LTCG` build and the plain objects give the link order |
| `defines` | `[]` | macros defined after a file's own flags (`TH06_EXE=1`) |
| `link_order` | `median` | object order: by the `median` or `first` original address of the functions only that object defines, or `source` order |
| `pch` | `""` | a header in `src/` to precompile (`global.h`): each object directory gets a `/Yc` stub, `pch.obj`, and every file whose `// cflags:` line changes no `/O` flag is compiled with `/FI` and `/Yu`. The header's inline functions then go at the end of each object, in the header's order, as in an original built that way |
| `ldflags` | `/SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS /FIXED /NODEFAULTLIB:libc.lib` | linker flags |
| `libs` | `libcmt.lib` | libraries, in the original's order |
| `features` | `{}` | `FEAT` names and their macros: `frame_cap = "FEAT_FRAME_CAP"` compiles `FEAT=frame_cap` into `build/obj_frame_cap` with `/DFEAT_FRAME_CAP=1` |
| `feature_sources` | `{}` | sources only the exe with a feature builds and links: `frame_cap = ["src/exe/framecap.cpp"]`; without the feature they make no object, which would still count in the Rich header |

The exe's map is `build/<name>_exe.map`, the DLL's `build/<name>.map`.

### `[psdk]`, `[symbols]`, `[hooks]`, `[replay]`

| Key | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `psdk.libs` | `[]` | the import libraries `psdk-libs` extracts, as named on the media (`User32.Lib`) |
| `symbols.import_libs` | `.wine/drive_c/psdk/Lib`, `.wine/drive_c/dx8/lib` | where `seed_symbols.py` looks up decorated import names |
| `hooks.progress` | `false` | the pre-commit hook redraws `docs/progress.svg` and adds it |
| `hooks.compare` | `false` | the pre-commit hook fails unless every compiled function matches the original, or `hooks.allow_diff` lists it |
| `hooks.readme` | `false` | the pre-commit hook fails if `README.md` names a repository path that doesn't exist (gitignored places such as `build/` are skipped) |
| `hooks.allow_diff` | `[]` | functions, by their `symbols.csv` name, that are in `src/` though they don't match yet; `farm` permutes these |
| `replay.hook` | none | the game's Python file for `replay/replay.py`: its replay format, what its tracer patches and reads, and the run's setup (`replay.py` documents it) |

With `hooks.compare`, the pre-commit hook builds `src/` and runs the
comparison (`gate.py`); `src/` and `config/` may then have no unstaged
changes, so that what is built is what is committed. It also fails
when a function HEAD's `docs/progress.svg` shows as matching is no
longer compiled, such as one now inlined everywhere. A commit that
makes a listed function match takes it off `hooks.allow_diff`. For a
group of functions that only match together, commit them one at a time
with `DECOMP_ALLOW_DIFF=NAME[,NAME...]` set: the named functions may
differ in that commit. `git commit --no-verify` skips the hooks.

### The build hook

`build.hook` is for what the settings don't cover. The file may define:

- `exe_flags(feats)`: extra compiler flags for the standalone exe's
  objects, given the features asked for; it may also generate the files
  they need
- `headers()`: more headers whose changes rebuild everything
- `exe_resources(feats)`: the executable whose resources the standalone
  exe gets, instead of the original's

`examples/th06_build_hook.py` is th06's, for its English feature.

## The permuter

`just permute NAME` takes a function's definition in `src/` (NAME as
`symbols.csv` names it, `Stage::DrawLayer`), applies random rewrites
and compiles each variant alone with the file's flags, without
linking. A variant scores the instructions that differ from the
original, as `compare` cuts the function, plus 1000 for each other
function of the file it breaks; the search climbs towards 0. Most
rewrites must touch the lines whose code differs, which a `/Zd`
compile maps to source lines. `src/` is never written: the best
variant goes to `build/permute/STEM.c` (STEM is NAME with `::` as
`-`) and is printed as a diff. A variant that matches byte for byte is
correct by the match; any other may have changed the meaning.

| Option | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `-j N`, `-t S`, `-s SEED` | compiles at once, seconds, random seed |
| `--start FILE` | start from an earlier best variant |
| `--file` | also move the file's top-level declarations; the variant goes to `STEM.file` whole |
| `--sweep` | enumerate instead: declaration orders, operand swaps and single rewrites at the differing lines, beam search until a pass finds nothing (`sweep exhausted`) |
| `--decls` | every order of the local declarations, which decides stack slots and can sway registers |
| `--pad`, `--plan` | look for a shift of the compiler's symbol IDs (a VC5 effect, not seen with MSVC 7.1 so far) |

`just farm` runs it over every `hooks.allow_diff` function (or the
NAMEs given), `-p` functions at a time with `-j` compiles each, rounds
of a sweep and a `-t` second random search from the best variant so
far, `-r` rounds (0: until stopped). Matches land in `build/farm/`;
`just farm --apply NAME` writes one into `src/`. Under Wine, a
wineserver stays up between compiles, which makes each several times
faster. On Windows, `build.py` runs the compiler directly, finding
`C:\` paths of the build settings under `.wine/drive_c` first, and
`compare.py` disassembles with capstone, so a copy of the repository
with its prefix's `drive_c` and the original exe can farm there; copy
`build/farm/` back.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11 or later (for `tomllib`), [just](https://github.com/casey/just)
  recent enough for the `[default]` attribute (tested with 1.58)
- Wine (32-bit, with its `msidb`), binutils (`objdump`), 7-Zip
- For `run`: Xvfb, xdotool, ImageMagick, 32-bit Mesa OpenGL and the
  `ja_JP.UTF-8` locale
- The original toolchain in the Wine prefix (bring your own copies)
- Ghidra, for analysis
- On Windows (`permute`, `farm`, `build`, `compare` only): Python with
  `capstone`, run in UTF-8 mode (`PYTHONUTF8=1`)
