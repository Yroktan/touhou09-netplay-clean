USAGE="The commit rule the pre-commit hook checks when project.toml's\n[hooks] turns it on.\n\n    gate.py pre-commit    hooks.compare: every compiled function matches\n\nhooks.compare builds src/ and fails the commit unless every function it\ndefines matches the original byte for byte (`just compare`), and unless\nevery function HEAD's docs/progress.svg shows as matching is still\ncompiled: a change to an inline function or a struct can make the\ncompiler inline a function everywhere, so that its out-of-line copy is\nno longer emitted and silently drops out of the compare (that part\nneeds hooks.progress). src/ and config/ must have no unstaged changes,\nso what is built is what is committed.\n\nhooks.allow_diff lists functions, by their symbols.csv name, that are in\nsrc/ though they don't match, such as ones that are logically equivalent\nbut allocate registers differently. They may differ in every commit, and\nare the functions farm.py permutes by default. A commit that makes one\nmatch takes it off the list.\n\nA group of functions that only match together lands one function per\ncommit with DECOMP_ALLOW_DIFF=NAME[,NAME...] in the environment: the\nnamed functions may differ in that commit (the neighbour the group\nbreaks until it is complete). `git commit --no-verify` skips the hook.\n"
